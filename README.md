## Formatting Tips

1. **Headers**: Use consistent header levels (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
2. **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks with language specification
3. **Lists**: Use hyphens or asterisks for unordered lists, numbers for ordered
4. **Links**: `[text](url)` for inline links
5. **Images**: `![alt text](image-url)`
6. **Tables** (if needed):
```markdown
| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `param1`  | `string` | **Required**. Description. |
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it updated**: Outdated information can be worse than no information
2. **Be concise**: Long READMEs are less likely to be read completely
3. **Use examples**: Show don't just tell
4. **Consider your audience**: Technical level should match expected users
5. **Proofread**: Typos and errors reduce credibility
6. **Include contact info**: Email or Twitter if appropriate

Remember, the goal is to help users understand and use your project quickly and easily. A good README evolves with your project, so revisit and update it regularly.
